# CornerPlotting

Documentation for [CornerPlotting](https://github.com/orlox/CornerPlotting.jl).

`CornerPlotting` is meant to be a simple tool to produce corner plots, report credible intervals
using highest density intervals, and customize plots with extra elements aftewards. This package uses [Makie](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl) as a backend. For another tool for corner plots with a very extensive variety of options, be sure to check [PairPlots](https://github.com/sefffal/PairPlots.jl), which also uses Makie as a backend. Other alternatives include [StatsPlots.cornerplot](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/StatsPlots.jl#corrplot-and-cornerplot) and [CornerPlot](https://github.com/kilianbreathnach/CornerPlot.jl).
